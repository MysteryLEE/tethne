        PURPOSE :To Test the simplify_Multigraph functionality.

        DESCRIPTION : simplify_graph takes as input a multigraph i.e
        a graph having parallel edges in between 2 vertices/nodes
        and converts it to a simple graph i.e. with only one edge
        in between two nodes. And the weight of the new edge is equal
        to the number of edges that were collapsed.

        TESTED FOR : 1) Collapsed edges between vertices.
                     2) Weight of the new edges

        TEST DATA : any Multigraph.
